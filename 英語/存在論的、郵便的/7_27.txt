コンマの使用:

Original: "On the occasion of three works published in 1967 his works..."
Corrected: "On the occasion of three works published in 1967, his works..."
理由: 「On the occasion of three works published in 1967」という導入句の後にコンマを入れることで、主節と分ける必要があります。
所有代名詞の一致:

Original: "...extended these influence..."
Corrected: "...extended their influence..."
理由: 「works」は複数形なので、正しい所有代名詞は「these」ではなく「their」です。
FurtherとMoreの使い分け:

Original: "...extended these influence more in 1970's."
Corrected: "...extended their influence further in the 1970s."
理由: この文脈では、「more」よりも「further」が適切です。「further」は時間的な影響の拡大を示します。また、「1970's」は「the 1970s」に訂正すべきです。
年代の表記:

Original: "...more in 1970's."
Corrected: "...further in the 1970s."
理由: 十年間を示す正しい表記はアポストロフィなしの「the 1970s」です。
