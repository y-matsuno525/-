Do you usually start with a track? Or, how does writing work for you?
It varies. 
Usually time me and the boys get in the studio and I can just go off a simple drum loop that I like. 
My process, it starts from just a whole bunch of preed meditated thoughts the process of me thinking about the ideas and what I want to say next.
And by the time I get into the studio I have to find that exact sound that triggerd the emotion or the idea that I thought about two months ago.
Would you have more than one of those go on at same time like might you have six thoughts before you go into studio or do you do them(?) one at a(?) time?
So the concept come you'll sort of live with it and let it grow in you.
Do you make notes?
Definitely, all the time I have to make notes.Because a lot of inspiration come from meeting(?) people
